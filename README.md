# Curve-Fitting-and-Interpolation-App
## Description
Develop an application that illustrates the efficacy of different curve fitting and interpolation models.
### Features:
- The user can open and display an arbitrary signal (of reasonable length of 1000 points).
- The user can choose if the fitting to be done as one chunk or multiple ones.
- The user can choose the order of the fitting polynomial (either for the big chunk or the multiple ones).
- The fitting result is displayed in dotted line on the same graph that displays the original signal.
- The fitted equation and percentage error are shown in its mathematical form above the main graph using Latex format.
